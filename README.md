# Foodies_Demo (Instructions)
 Foodies App was designed to satisfy your taste buds by allowing the user to interact popular International cuisines. 
 The target is setup for IOS 17.5 minimum and configured to be utilizied for Iphone 12 and above.
 For building and running the app, click on the Product and Run button through XCode and it will diplay the parent view
 (ContentView).

## App Focus Area
The Food App offers variety of friendly features which makes it great experience for cooking.
- Search and Filter Options: Search button to find recipes based on world cuisine types and filters alphabetically.
- Recipes Collections: Access the curated collection from your favorite confection. Simple one touch design to scroll through recipes in which the   combination of ScrollView and LazyVStack does not create new items unless
the user needs to render and display onscreen.
- Images are cached on disk/memory using KingFisher api, and the cach storage expiration date is set to 90 days.
Design Implmentation: Having done some research on conventional UI interface from social media, cooking recipes apps, decided to apply the Grid View from URL image with shadow, masking and overlaying the cuisine and dish name. Adjusted the resolution and aligment if the user sees the UIView in dimmer setting. 

## Time Spent
Understanding this app design needs to be production ready, done some research on how to apply Unit testing for JSON parsing, applying the search button to filter through cuisines and convetional UI Column and Cell practices to display recipe images and text. 24 hours to develop the app with 8 hours spent individually for writing the production code, researching food recipe UI design and Unit testing methods. 

## Trade-offs and Decisions: 
There was no significant tradeoff for this application. Perhaps spending more time researching competitors app and website to get a better understanding of design principles and best practices. Working with other techniques to apply the image caching. 

## Weakest Part of the Project:
Using third party API for rendering and caching the image. Swifts Async Image has some issues and slow down in the past rendering the image based on image cache and size.

## External Code and Dependencies:
Kingfisher API image loading framework

## Additional Information: 
Having worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years managing a Japanese restaurant in New York City in past profession, it was a pleasure working with application built to inspire home cooking. I am interested in tackling this assignment using Kotlin in Jetpack Compose framework, but this will take more than 5 hours typically completed by other candidates.
